For example, if Alice is buying Bob’s call option for  an underlying 1 BTC and needs to pay a premium of 100 USD to Bob’s   bank account, AgoraDesk escrows 1 BTC from Bob’s AgoraDesk wallet  balance as soon as the trade is opened. Then, Alice asks for Bob’s bank account details and transfers the money. If Bob doesn’t receive it, he opens a dispute and an AgoraDesk staff member will  step in to determine whether Bob received the money. If he didn’t, then AgoraDesk will cancel the trade and the escrow is released  back to Bob.\n              <br />\n              <br />\nIf Alice did transfer the premium and Bob confirms it, the option trade enters into its active stage and Alice is able to exercise  the option at any time before the expiration date. If she doesn’t,  the escrow is returned to Bob and that concludes the trade. If she does, then the relevant amount of the underlying asset is released from the escrow to her, and that concludes the trade. Even if Bob  disappeared, he would have no way to not fulfill his obligations, since AgoraDesk escrowed the entire underlying amount.",

	"agoradesk.guide.risk-elimination.html-description": "Counterparty risk, put simply, is the risk that the other side in the option trade will not fulfill their obligations. Here's how AgoraDesk eliminates such risk in option trading.",
	"agoradesk.guide.risk-elimination.introduction": "Counterparty risk, put simply, is the risk that the other side in the option trade will not fulfill their obligations.",
	"agoradesk.guide.risk-elimination.put.content": "In the case of a put trade, the counterparty risk is either due to the put buyer not paying the premium or due to the fact that when the put option is exercised by the put buyer, the put seller does not honor the obligation to buy the underlying asset.\n<br/><br/>\nAgoraDesk eliminates both of these risks through our escrow mechanism and the use of a cover payment. The cover payment is basically two payments condensed (or “netted”) into one. In a put option, the put seller is obligated to buy the put buyer’s underlying asset for the notional value of the contract. The put buyer is obligated to pay a non-refundable premium. Instead of these two separate payments, AgoraDesk achieves the same effect by simply requiring the put seller at the beginning of the trade to pay the put buyer the notional value minus the premium. This way, the put buyer receives payment for their underlying asset at the very start of the trade, and the put seller has no way of disappearing without fulfilling their obligations to the put buyer, since they effectively fulfill their obligations at the very start of the trade. At the end, if the put option expires, the put seller will receive the notional value’s worth of the underlying asset from the escrow, and the rest of the escrow is returned to the put buyer. If the put option is exercised, the full escrow is simply released to the put seller.<br/><br/>\nFor example, if Alice is buying Bob’s put option for an underlying 20 XMR with a notional value of 1000 EUR (i.e. the exercise price is 50 EUR per XMR) and a premium of 100 EUR, the entire 20 XMR get escrowed from Alice’s AgoraDesk wallet balance as the trade starts. After that, Bob asks Alice for her bank account details and makes the cover payment of (notional – premium) EUR, in this case (1000 – 100) = 900 EUR to Alice’s bank account. If Alice doesn’t receive the payment, she can open a dispute and an AgoraDesk staff member will step in to determine whether Alice received the money. If she didn’t, then AgoraDesk will cancel the trade and the escrow will be released back to Alice.<br/><br/>\nIf Bob transfers the cover payment and Alice confirms it, the option trade enters into its active stage and Alice is able to exercise the option at any time before the expiration date. If she doesn’t, this means that the market value of the escrowed underlying 20 XMR is now higher than the notional value of 1000 EUR. If, for example, the market value of the 20 XMR rose to 1250 EUR (i.e. 1 XMR = 62.5 EUR) at the time of the option’s expiration, Bob is given 1000 EUR (the notional value of the option) worth of XMR from the escrow, in this case (1000 / 62.5) = 16 XMR. So, Bob started by giving Alice 900 EUR, and ended with 16 XMR valued at 1000 EUR, therefore Bob profits the 100 EUR premium. The rest of the escrowed underlying, in this case (20 – 16) = 4 XMR, is returned to Alice. Alice received 900 EUR at the start of the trade as the cover payment from Bob, and she ends the trade with 4 XMR valued at 250 EUR, meaning her assets have a total worth of 1150 EUR, which is precisely the value appreciation of the underlying XMR minus the premium she had to pay for the option.<br/><br/>\nIf, on the other hand, the value of the escrowed 20 XMR goes below the notional value of 1000 EUR, Alice exercises the option (i.e. “sells” her underlying), and the full escrow of 20 XMR is simply released to Bob. Alice has no way to exercise the option without the escrow being released to Bob, so Bob is never under risk that the underlying asset won’t be delivered to him.",

Go to the wallet page and deposit at least {balance} BTC for your selling ads to be visible. {linebreak} After you've made sure the coins are in your FRONT_TYPE wallet, you need to create an advertisement to sell a Bitcoin call option (called a call sell advertisement). When making the advertisement you choose a payment method, set your pricing, premium, expiry, your limits and write your terms of the trade as a free form message. {linebreak} When a buyer opens a trade with you, Bitcoin for the full amount of the contract is automatically taken from your wallet into escrow. You will receive email and/or Telegram notifications when someone replies to your advertisement. {linebreak} The first thing that happens when you sell a call option is that the buyer needs to pay you the premium in the amount displayed on the trade page. Give the buyer payment instructions and guide the buyer through paying the premium. If they fail to complete the payment within the payment window, you will be able to cancel the trade. {linebreak} Once the buyer has paid the premium and pressed the 'I have paid' button you will receive a notification that the premium has been paid. Make sure you have received the payment before pressing the 'Confirm payment' button. Never confirm the payment unless you are 100% sure you have received it - there have been scammers who try to trick sellers into prematurely confirming the payment. {linebreak} Once you've confirmed the payment, the option contract will activate. To your right you'll see a countdown timer that'll show you when the option expires. Should the option expire, you'll receive the \tunderlying coins back and keep the premium. {linebreak} If the buyer decides to exercise the option, they'll receive a portion of the underlying equivalent to the difference between the notional value and the current market value of the underlying. The rest of the underlying will be returned to you. {linebreak}\nIn some cases, the buyer might want to exercise the option with gross settlement, where they will have to make the payment for the full notional amount of the trade. The same rules apply here as with the premium payment - never release, until you've made absolutely sure that you've received the payment. Once you press the 'Release' button, your coins will be transferred to the buyer - which will conclude the trade..{linebreak} The final step is to leave feedback for the buyer and encourage the buyer to do the same for you. Feedback is important in order to gain reputation and make more trades.",

You are not obliged to release a trade until you can verify that you have received the buyer's payment. <br/><br/><strong>Don't open any links that your trading partner is sending to you</strong>. If you must, use different browser than the one you are using. <br/><br/>Don't visit websites other than FRONT_TYPE with the browser that you're using to trade. <strong>Use a different browser for other websites.</strong> <br/><br/> Bookmark FRONT_TYPE in your browser and always use the bookmark when visiting the website.
