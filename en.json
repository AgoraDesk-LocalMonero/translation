For example, if Alice is buying Bob’s call option for  an underlying 1 BTC and needs to pay a premium of 100 USD to Bob’s   bank account, AgoraDesk escrows 1 BTC from Bob’s AgoraDesk wallet  balance as soon as the trade is opened. Then, Alice asks for Bob’s bank account details and transfers the money.

Scammers will often try to trick the other  side into confirming the payment early.

	"agoradesk.guide.risk-elimination.html-description": "Counterparty risk, put simply, is the risk that the other side in the option trade will not fulfill their obligations. Here's how AgoraDesk eliminates such risk in option trading.",
	"agoradesk.guide.risk-elimination.introduction": "Counterparty risk, put simply, is the risk that the other side in the option trade will not fulfill their obligations.",
	"agoradesk.guide.risk-elimination.put.content": "In the case of a put trade, the counterparty risk is either due to the put buyer not paying the premium or due to the fact that when the put option is exercised by the put buyer, the put seller does not honor the obligation to buy the underlying asset.\n<br/><br/>\nAgoraDesk eliminates both of these risks through our escrow mechanism and the use of a cover payment. The cover payment is basically two payments condensed (or “netted”) into one. In a put option, the put seller is obligated to buy the put buyer’s underlying asset for the notional value of the contract. The put buyer is obligated to pay a non-refundable premium. Instead of these two separate payments, AgoraDesk achieves the same effect by simply requiring the put seller at the beginning of the trade to pay the put buyer the notional value minus the premium. This way, the put buyer receives payment for their underlying asset at the very start of the trade, and the put seller has no way of disappearing without fulfilling their obligations to the put buyer, since they effectively fulfill their obligations at the very start of the trade. At the end, if the put option expires, the put seller will receive the notional value’s worth of the underlying asset from the escrow, and the rest of the escrow is returned to the put buyer. If the put option is exercised, the full escrow is simply released to the put seller.<br/><br/>\nFor example, if Alice is buying Bob’s put option for an underlying 20 XMR with a notional value of 1000 EUR (i.e. the exercise price is 50 EUR per XMR) and a premium of 100 EUR, the entire 20 XMR get escrowed from Alice’s AgoraDesk wallet balance as the trade starts. After that, Bob asks Alice for her bank account details and makes the cover payment of (notional – premium) EUR, in this case (1000 – 100) = 900 EUR to Alice’s bank account. If Alice doesn’t receive the payment, she can open a dispute and an AgoraDesk staff member will step in to determine whether Alice received the money. If she didn’t, then AgoraDesk will cancel the trade and the escrow will be released back to Alice.<br/><br/>\nIf Bob transfers the cover payment and Alice confirms it, the option trade enters into its active stage and Alice is able to exercise the option at any time before the expiration date. If she doesn’t, this means that the market value of the escrowed underlying 20 XMR is now higher than the notional value of 1000 EUR. If, for example, the market value of the 20 XMR rose to 1250 EUR (i.e. 1 XMR = 62.5 EUR) at the time of the option’s expiration, Bob is given 1000 EUR (the notional value of the option) worth of XMR from the escrow, in this case (1000 / 62.5) = 16 XMR. So, Bob started by giving Alice 900 EUR, and ended with 16 XMR valued at 1000 EUR, therefore Bob profits the 100 EUR premium. The rest of the escrowed underlying, in this case (20 – 16) = 4 XMR, is returned to Alice. Alice received 900 EUR at the start of the trade as the cover payment from Bob, and she ends the trade with 4 XMR valued at 250 EUR, meaning her assets have a total worth of 1150 EUR, which is precisely the value appreciation of the underlying XMR minus the premium she had to pay for the option.<br/><br/>\nIf, on the other hand, the value of the escrowed 20 XMR goes below the notional value of 1000 EUR, Alice exercises the option (i.e. “sells” her underlying), and the full escrow of 20 XMR is simply released to Bob. Alice has no way to exercise the option without the escrow being released to Bob, so Bob is never under risk that the underlying asset won’t be delivered to him.",

Go to the wallet page and deposit at least {balance} BTC for your selling ads to be visible. {linebreak} After you've made sure the coins are in your FRONT_TYPE wallet, you need to create an advertisement to sell a Bitcoin call option (called a call sell advertisement). When making the advertisement you choose a payment method, set your pricing, premium, expiry, your limits and write your terms of the trade as a free form message. {linebreak} When a buyer opens a trade with you, Bitcoin for the full amount of the contract is automatically taken from your wallet into escrow. You will receive email and/or Telegram notifications when someone replies to your advertisement. {linebreak} The first thing that happens when you sell a call option is that the buyer needs to pay you the premium in the amount displayed on the trade page. Give the buyer payment instructions and guide the buyer through paying the premium. If they fail to complete the payment within the payment window, you will be able to cancel the trade. {linebreak} Once the buyer has paid the premium and pressed the 'I have paid' button you will receive a notification that the premium has been paid. Make sure you have received the payment before pressing the 'Confirm payment' button. Never confirm the payment unless you are 100% sure you have received it - there have been scammers who try to trick sellers into prematurely confirming the payment. {linebreak} Once you've confirmed the payment, the option contract will activate. To your right you'll see a countdown timer that'll show you when the option expires. Should the option expire, you'll receive the \tunderlying coins back and keep the premium. {linebreak} If the buyer decides to exercise the option, they'll receive a portion of the underlying equivalent to the difference between the notional value and the current market value of the underlying. The rest of the underlying will be returned to you. {linebreak}\nIn some cases, the buyer might want to exercise the option with gross settlement, where they will have to make the payment for the full notional amount of the trade. The same rules apply here as with the premium payment - never release, until you've made absolutely sure that you've received the payment. Once you press the 'Release' button, your coins will be transferred to the buyer - which will conclude the trade..{linebreak} The final step is to leave feedback for the buyer and encourage the buyer to do the same for you.

This article builds off of the concepts presented in there.</i></p>\n\n<p>Whenever individuals discuss the problems with blockchain, one of the first words to pop up will be 'scaling'. It's not a secret that blockchains don't scale well, but most people don't know why.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is, scaling is actually an umbrella term that covers two different categories: Protocol support and technological support at a given point in time. In this article, we're going to focus our attention on one, Protocol support is basically a measure of how many transactions the protocol can handle at a given time.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin has a block size limit, which means once enough transactions are included in a block, any additional transactions will have to wait in line for the next block. A helpful analogy would be thinking about a train. A train pulls up to the station, and those in line file in. Once the train is full, anyone left outside will have to wait for the next one.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin uses fees to determine who gets into the block or not. Jumping back to the train analogy, one can imagine one potential passenger, that is about to be left behind, offers the train engineer five dollars to give him a seat. Other passengers follow suit, and eventually there is a bidding war to see who gets which seats. It's up to the driver to decide if he wants to honor the first-come-first-serve policy, but it's in his best financial interest to maximize his income by taking the highest bidders on board.</p>\n\n<p>In this analogy, miners are the train drivers. They can include whatever transactions they want in the block, but they will generally choose the ones that have the highest paid fees.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, if blocks are not very full, people have no incentive to pay high fees because there are plenty of free seats to spare.</p>\n\n<p>In the height of the 2017 cryptocurrency boom, Bitcoin was flooded with transactions, and the fees skyrocketed for those that wanted to be included in the next block, or any near-future block for that matter. Those who were unwilling to pay high fees saw their transactions pushed back for hours, days, or even drop out of the queue altogether.</p>\n\n<p>This was a harrowing insight into how Bitcoin would fare if the oft talked about ‘mass adoption’ were to occur. If Bitcoin was to be used by the masses, things would be even worse than in 2017, and Bitcoin would be inaccessible to anyone but the wealthy, simply because the throughput is small due to a fixed block size, causing the fee market to take over.</p>\n\n<p>Monero foresaw this and wanted to do something different. So the Monero developers implemented a dynamic blocksize.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, Monero also has a block size cap, but it’s a soft cap. When the line of waiting transactions gets too long, the miners can increase the size of the blocks. With our train analogy, you can imagine adding more train cars to fit the extra passengers. After the queue is empty the blocks shrink back to their original size going forward.</p>\n\n<p>If this seems like a neat idea, it seems reasonable to ask why Monero is the only cryptocurrency that has implemented this. Why not add it on Bitcoin so as to put a stop to the throughput issues?</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this is not possible. There are several reasons why, and we’ll do our best to explain.</p>\n\n<p> It's always in a miner's best interest to have large blocks. With large blocks they can fit in more transactions, and make more money off of the fees, as well as the block rewards. This has the potential to lead to spam attacks, where someone sends many small transactions, with small fees, to bloat the chain. Miner's would just raise the block size include them all because money is money, no matter how small. This would lead to consistently large blocks with little economic benefit. Bitcoin solves this by artificially restricting the block size, thereby generating a fee market. Spam attackers would have to outpay the other users in fees, and it is no longer cheap. But this means blocks get full leaving some transactions waiting as mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>So how can Monero have dynamic blocksizes but avoid spam attacks? The answer is simple, but clever. A penalty on the block reward is introduced when a block is bigger than normal. If a miner wants to increase the blocksize, the reward they get from finding that block will be less than they would otherwise receive. So they will only increase the blocksize when the paid transaction fees of the users outweigh the lost portion of the block reward. For example, if the miner would lose 0.5 XMR by raising the block reward, and the sum of the paid transaction fees would be 0.4 XMR, then there would be a net loss of 0.1 XMR if they were to raise the size, so they wouldn’t do it. Conversely, if the total transaction fees added up to 0.7 XMR, then there would be a net gain of 0.2 XMR, even though they lose the 0.5 XMR from the block reward penalty, so the miner will increase the size.</p>\n\n<p>These dynamic blocks, allow the network to grow organically, without aritifically restricting the blocksize to make a forced fee market, while still avoiding spam attacks. There are several more angles we can view this idea from, and more reasons why it wouldn't be possible to add to Bitcoin, but for now, we hope that the reader has an understanding of how Monero sidesteps several of the problems in Bitcoin and its derivatives, and how it plans to scale its throughput into the future.</p>",

	"knowledge.blocks.title": "How Monero Solved the Block Size Problem That Plagues Bitcoin",
	"knowledge.clsag.0.text": "<p>As a protocol, Monero is currently in a constant state of innovation. Utilizing research in both on-chain and off-chain solutions, the Monero community looks for areas to improve to make Monero more private, more scaleable, and more accessible to all. One of the more recent innovations is the replacement of the linkable ring signature scheme, MLSAG, with a drop-in replacement CLSAG, which stands for Concise Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group.</p>\n\n<p>On the surface level, the implementation of CLSAG will decrease the most common 2 input, 2 output transactions by 25%. We’ll also see a 10% decrease in verification time.</p>\n\n<p>But what exactly is CLSAG? What does it do, and how does it differ from the old version, MLSAG? Let’s take a minute to remind ourselves of the why and how of ring signatures so we can better understand this concept. Ring signatures allow for non-interactive, witness indistinguishable inputs by use of signer-selected anonymity sets of previous outputs. In laymen’s terms, it allows a user to hide their outputs used in a transaction alongside unrelated outputs, and they can do all of this without needing anyone else to take part. All you need is a copy of the blockchain. Each of these outputs mostly appear to be equally probable of being the actual one being sent, thereby hiding metadata about the sender.</p>\n\n<p>This begets a bit of a problem, however. What if a user was to construct a ring signature with all decoy outputs? How would anyone know that the unknown sender doesn't have the authority to send any of them? Would this user be able to spend fake money? The answer is no. The ring signature includes a method for proving that at least one of the outputs is owned by the unknown sender, without revealing which one it is. In fact, both CLSAG and MLSAG (henceforth known as the SAGs) are the part of the ring signature that proves this. Interestingly, at the same time, it proves that the amount of the transaction, though hidden behind confidential transactions (RingCT), balances. That the SAGs prove two things, that one output is owned by someone in the ring, and that the transaction balances, is important, and actually where the size and verification savings lies. If this is getting confusing, don't worry, we'll get to a fun, and easy-to-understand analogy soon.</p>\n\n<p>The old signature scheme, MLSAG (Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group) proves the aforementioned two things in a ring signature, but it does each separately. The use of separate computations for signing and commitment keys means slower operations. A modern computer can do these computations in a matter of milliseconds, which doesn’t seem like much, and indeed, for one transaction it’s not. But when we consider the sheer number of transactions on the Monero blockchain, and that a node syncing from scratch will have to download and verify each of them, the bytes and milliseconds start to pile up quickly.</p>\n\n<p>CLSAG combines the maths necessary to prove both into one, as well as computes both of them at once, and it does so in a safe manner. What does this mean in a safe manner? Well, to clear this up, as well as hopefully make the whole thing make more sense, let’s explore that promised fun analogy.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say you need to go to both the grocery store and the hardware store, to pick up two different things: food and toxic cleaning chemicals. You don’t want them to intermix, as if there is an accident, the chemicals will spill on the food, making them inedible. You decide to be super safe and drive from your house to the grocery store, buy the food, and then drive back to your house. Only after you have unloaded the food do you get back in the car, drive to the hardware store, and back to your house with the chemicals. You’ve taken two separate trips to ensure the safety of all purchases. Though it is indeed safe, it is inefficient. This represents MLSAG, where two different sets of maths are stored and two different ‘trips’ are made to compute them.</p>\n\n<p>You decide you want a faster way to do this, however. It’s too much wasted time. Sure doing it once or twice isn’t going to steal your life away, but having to do this over and over, the hours begin to add up. You start to wonder if you can make one trip instead. From your house, to the grocery store, to the hardware store, and back home. You can’t just go and throw everything in your car haphazardly. It’s not safe. Instead, you designate different spots in your car for different things, and make sure everything fits neatly in its place. In so doing, you’re able to safely make one trip to both stores, and keep things away from each other. This represents CLSAG. There is now only one set of math stored in this transaction to prove these two things, and it’s done in away that they don’t interfere with each other. A trip has to still be made, but you’ve reduced the number of them quite drastically.</p>\n\n<p>All of this sounds quite exciting. Is it possible we can find other shortcuts, or other ways to save on time and space? The answer is yes and no. According to current MRL researchers, it's likely not possible to further modify the SAG-type constructions for better size or speed; however other constructions like Arcturus, Omniring, RCT3, or Triptych produce much better size scaling and verification benefits using different mathematical methods. However, each of these 'next-gen' approaches to signer-ambiguous protocols comes with its own tradeoffs in implementation details, and are undergoing active research and investigation.</p>\n\n<p>After all, Monero is always innovating.</p>",

It doesn’t have a big claim to fame such as being a ‘world computer’ or ‘revolutionizing xyz industry’. It’s just trying to be a private, digital, fungible money, and every upgrade and new technology just furthers this end. </p>\n<p>\nThose that deem this goal as too narrow or uninteresting generally don’t understand how difficult it is to achieve meaningful privacy, especially on a permanent, open ledger like a blockchain. Any avenue for metadata leakage is a potential for privacy erosion.</p>\n<p>\nMonero takes precautions to obfuscate on-chain data, such as the receiver, sender, and amounts, via stealth addresses, ring signatures, and Pedersen commitments respectively. This minimizes the chances of a casual observer from deducing critical info after transactions have already been sent and are now just a part of recorded history. There are, however some attacks that can be done the moment a transaction occurs that cannot be performed any time later.</p>",
	"knowledge.dandelion.0.title": "Privacy as priority",
	"knowledge.dandelion.1.text": "These attacks revolve around identifying which IP address a transaction came from. If this information is deduced it could reveal that an individual sent a Monero transaction. It’s not able to show to who, and how much, but there are some cases where the knowledge of someone using Monero is enough to cause harm. \n<br/><br/>\nThe good news is, that if this information is not gleaned the moment the transaction is made, then it cannot be learned at a later date, since IP addresses are not stored on the blockchain. It is also comforting to know that such an attack is unlikely to be seen in the wild, as, in order to pull it off, the attacker would need a large majority of nodes on the network. If a person was able to command this large majority, however, they would be able to identify the “direction” a transaction came from.\n<br/><br/>\nThis may be confusing, so we’ll explain some background info here. Each node connects to other nodes on the network, so that they can keep their blockchain up to date, as well as share what they know with others. These connections allow them to learn about new transactions, propagate them, and send their own. Since a node can only tell their peers about transactions they know about, it stands to reason that the very first node that propagates a transaction is the node that is actually sending Monero.\n<br/><br/>\nIf an attacker owns a large majority of nodes on the network, each node will hear about a transaction from one of their peers, and based on the timing in which each node receives this information, they can deduce likely candidates for where the transaction started.\n<br/><br/>\nIf this is still confusing, we offer this example. Suppose we both have a mutual friend that is hiding from our vision. This friend calls out loudly. I hear his call first, and I hear it louder than you do. From this information, we can know that I am likely closer to our friend than you are. The fact that you hear the sound later (even by just a split second) and the sound is fainter means that we should start our search around my area, not yours.\n<br/><br/>\nIf an attacker is able to successfully guess which of their peers sent the transaction, since they have the IP address that is connected to their node and forwarded it to them, they can be certain of the IP address that sent it. This is powerful information, as IP addresses contains information about the country and internet service provider (ISP) of the user, and the ISP themselves know which user is linked to which exact IP address, effectively deanonymizing the Monero user.",
	"knowledge.dandelion.1.title": "Attack to reveal IP address",
	"knowledge.dandelion.2.text": "One possible mitigation for this attack is usage of an overlay network such as Tor or I2P. This makes it so that even if an attacker can deduce a source IP address, it’s probably not the one that made the transaction, but rather the outproxy (I2P) or exit node (Tor) of the overlay network. This is not an all-encompassing solution however, as overlay networks, VPNs, and similar software is banned in many countries, and expecting everyone to use, sync, and propagate on these networks is unrealistic.  There needs to be a solution that doesn’t require the usage of external software and networks; one that is available to the common person.\n<br/><br/>\nThis solution is Dandelion++ (DPP), which is an upgraded protocol to the original Dandelion proposal for Bitcoin. In this protocol, there are two phases, the stem phase, and the fluff phase; both of them together are supposed to represent the form of a dandelion.\n<br/><br/>\nIn the stem phase, every few minutes, the sending node randomly chooses two peers out of all of the nodes it’s connected to. When the sending node sends a transaction, either on behalf of itself or just forwarding the transaction from another node in the stem phase, it randomly chooses one of these two selected peers and sends the transaction to it.\n<br/><br/>\nThe fluff phase is when a node receives a transaction and broadcasts it to every outgoing connection, rather than just to one randomly chosen one, this allows true transaction propagation. Every few minutes a node defines itself as one that will either propagate via stem or via fluff at random, so a stem phase can be quite long if each connecting node has defined itself as a stem node, but once the transaction hits the fluff phase, it stays there.\n<br/><br/>\nThis means that an attacker will not be able to simply listen for the direction of a transaction anymore, because before it was propagated to everyone, it underwent the stem phase, and the originating node of the fluff phase is not the node the transaction originated from, and it is unknown how many hops along the stem the transaction underwent.\n<br/><br/>\nOf course, combining the solutions above (DPP plus an overlay network) will give even stronger guarantees of privacy and protection against IP tracing. It should also be noted, that DPP does not defend against another form of network tracing attack that can be done with ISPs, but this is beyond the scope of this article.\n<br/><br/>\nDandelion++ is set to go live on the Monero network, and be used by default on the reference client, in the 0.16 release. This small change will further mitigate the attacks possible on the Monero network, and exemplifies why Monero leads the pack in practical, applied privacy technologies.",

	"knowledge.emission.0.text": "<p>When most people think of what sets Monero apart, they think of Monero’s privacy technology. Indeed, most would consider the privacy, and the fungibility that it unlocks, as Monero’s defining trait, and the main weapon it brings into the ring when compared to other coins. What most people might not know is that Monero contains other protocol differences from Bitcoin and its derivatives that some might argue are just as important as Monero’s privacy technologies. In this article, we will look at one of these: the tail emission.</p>\n\n<p>First, let’s define what this term means. A tail emission is an unceasing subsidy of block rewards, even after the ‘last’ Monero is minted. In other words, Monero’s block reward will never fall to zero, but rather fall until it reaches 0.6 XMR per block, and then stay there forever. Miners will always be paid to mine Monero, and will never have to solely rely on a fee market.</p>\n\n<p>But let’s take a step back for a moment, and look at mining on a very high level. Monero miners are incentivized to secure a network by mining hashes. The incentive is the opportunity to make Monero if they find a new block. This Monero is awarded in two ways. Firstly, the miner receives the paid fees of every user who paid for their transaction's inclusion in the block. These are the transaction fees that you pay when you send a transaction. Secondly, the miner receives a predetermined amount of Monero from the protocol itself. In most cases, this ‘block reward’ is substantially higher than the user transaction fees, and is where miners make the most money. This block reward serves to keep the miners financially invested in the chain’s security, but also to get new coins into circulation.</p>\n\n<p>In most cryptocurrency protocols, this block reward is set to decrease over time. Most Bitcoin derivatives have what are called halvenings, predetermined points in time where the block reward halves (such as from 20 BTC to 10 BTC). These halvenings happen every few years, and every time it happens, the security on the network decreases. Why? Well, we encourage the reader to read our <a class=\"next-link\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-mining-randomx\" target=\"_blank\">article on Mining and RandomX</a>, and in doing so they will learn that mining is a race. Block rewards are only given out to those who find a block, and there are many entities in competition to do so. When the rewards are higher, more people are interested in playing this game, whereas when the rewards are low, less people, even those with the equipment to do so, will be willing to use their time and resources on a chance to win a measly prize.</p>\n\n<p>Already we begin to scratch the surface of the reason for Monero’s tail emission. Monero too has a decreasing block reward, although unlike Bitcoin there are no halvenings. Instead, each block reward is a tiny amount less than the previous one, so the reduction is much smoother. But the question for all cryptocurrencies is: “What happens when the block reward hits zero?” This is a strange situation in which we both know and don’t know the answer. The part we know is that there will be no more block reward subsidy, which means miners will have to be incentivized by the user transaction fees alone. What we don’t know is if these amounts will be enough to keep the miners securing the chain.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, at present time, the block reward outweighs the transaction fees by a substantial amount, so the hope is that, as more users use the chain, fees would increase, and with increased fees the miners will deem it worth their time to continue mining. There is another side to this scenario however, the side of the users. If fees increase, then it will become much more expensive to transact with cryptocurrency for everyone, potentially walling it off from those without sufficient monetary resources. But on the other hand, if the fees stay low and the block reward goes to zero, then very few miners will secure the network, leaving it vulnerable to 51% attacks and reversed transactions.</p>\n\n<p>Nobody has good answers for this scenario, and no major coin has yet entered this phase of their cryptocurrency's life, so we have no real-world experience with it either. It’s all speculation. A gamble. Bitcoin makes the bet that the fees will be enough to sustain the miners, even if it means excluding the impoverished. Monero makes a different bet. Monero bets that the fees alone would not be enough for chain security, so it includes a tail emission as part of the protocol.</p>\n\n<p>We remind the reader that the block reward will not fall below 0.6 XMR per block, ever. Will this be enough to incentivize miners? We don’t know, but it’s certainly better than 0, which is what almost every other currency has built in to their protocol.</p>\n\n<p>The main criticism levied against this approach is that this means Monero’s supply is theoretically infinite, causing inflation over time, while coins that cap the block reward have a finite supply, their scarcity increasing the value over time. We feel this argument is insufficient for several reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, what good is a scarce, high-value coin that is easily attacked, censored, and subverted due to low security? If anything, the low security would decrease the value, more than offsetting what increase the scarcity would provide. Secondly, though Monero’s supply is theoretically infinite, the inflation is linear and trends toward zero as a yearly percentage, unlike fiat which is exponential.</p>\n\n<p>Monero’s inflation is precisely known ahead of time, and can be accurately projected, unlike fiat which may increase by more or less on a given year based on the whims of the powers that be. This still preserves the cypherpunk spirit of removing the possibility of human corruption through protocol enforced technology. With the added benefit of the peace of mind that the security of Monero’s blockchain through mining will be around as long as the world needs it.</p>\n\n<p>The last point we want to touch on is one of fairness. Money is used in several ways, as a store of value, as a medium of exchange, and as a unit of account. In a system where supply is finite, inflation will stop, meaning that those that use it as a store of value use the system for free. They benefit from the continued security provided by the miners without paying anything for it, since without inflation, their money does not slowly lose value over time. Conversely, anyone who uses the currency as a medium of exchange gets penalized (via potentially high transaction fees). This will encourage people to hold but not spend, and skews the fairness of the system to favor holders. By having a tail emission, this evens out the equation. Now holders also pay a small tax, via inflation, for the system's security. The tail emission makes it more fair for everyone.</p>",

Mining secures a blockchain from double spends via Nakamoto Consensus. The exact intricacies of how it does this are beyond the scope of this article, but they can be learned from many different sources around the internet. What matters is that the security comes from hashes generated by computers (miners), in competition with one another to find the mathematical solution necessary to create another block. As they do this, they add new transactions to the blockchain. In return for their work (hashes) they are compensated with newly minted coins.\n<br/><br/>\nThere are a number of issues that can occur with this setup, and they require proper incentives to work correctly, but we’re going to focus in on one particular problem that might arise.

Some computers are powerful enough to run AI networks or intense games, while others struggle with even simple tasks. These differences in computing power also affect the rate hash rate, or the rate at which they look for block solutions. <br/><br/>\nBut even these differences between computers pale in comparison to the hash rates of specialized hardware, otherwise known as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which outclass regular computers by several order of magnitude.<br/><br/>\nLet’s take some time to explore what makes ASICs so powerful. Imagine all computers as falling somewhere on a spectrum, which ranges from being able to do many things, but nothing well, to doing only one thing, but doing it very well. CPUs and ASICs are on opposite ends of this spectrum.<br/><br/>\nCPUs that are in all standard computers are on the first end. They can do many things, like browse the web, play games, or render video, but not do any of them particularly well. But this flexibility comes at the cost of efficiency.<br/><br/>\nASICs are on the other end, where they can just one thing, but do it at an incredible rate. They can only perform one mathematical function, but because they can ignore everything else, the performance gains are astronomical. This efficiency however, does come at the cost of flexibility, so if the function changes even slightly – an example is x + y = z changes to 2x + y = z – then the ASIC will cease to function altogether. <br/><br/>\nNot everyone owns an ASIC, but everyone does own computers.

It does this by requiring miners to make and execute random code in place of hashing based off of an algorithm.<br/><br/>\nIt may be confusing how this actually helps anything, so let’s go back to our printer analogy. Remember what happened when the design changed? The old monster printers become obsolete every night, and new ones had to be developed with the new design in mind. What would happen if every new lottery prize ticket, had to adhere to a new design standard for every new jackpot? <br/><br/>\nCreating a new monster printer would become incredibly difficult. You can’t just plan on one ticket design anymore. Since the design is random, the monster printer makers would have to add color capabilities, ways to print different lettering and borders and shapes and more. In short, the machine they ended up inventing would be a standard, regular printer.

We do know that cryptocurrencies in general are on the radar of many government agencies, and have reason to believe Monero is, moreso than others, for the above stated reasons, but, as of yet, few moves have been made by the governments of any country in regards to outright banning Monero.</p>\n\n<p>Even so, the Monero community is committed to fighting the good fight. We believe financial privacy is something that is essential for freedom, and that everyone should have the option to transact privately without governments, corporations, or anyone else spying on you.</p>\n\n<p>One reassurance we can give, however, is that at one point Bitcoin had the exact same reputation that Monero does now. It was thought to be the criminal’s coin, and completely private and anonymous, but slowly, over time, the public came to accept Bitcoin regardless. </p>\n\n<p>Now one might argue that Bitcoin’s reputation changed as people realized that it really wasn’t private or anonymous, but this isn’t true, as the notion that Bitcoin is completely private and can’t be traced is still pervasive not only in the general public, but amongst those regulating the industry. These people still believe it is private, so they basically believe it to be what Monero actually is, and yet we’re quickly moving into a world where it is gaining acceptance with the public, businesses, and governing bodies.

	"knowledge.myths.10.text": "<p>One common complaint about most coins smaller than Bitcoin is how easy it is to theoretically 51% attack them. Indeed, several small coins, such as Vertcoin did get successfully 51% attacked several times.</p>\n\n<p>Most of these concerns arise from the website https://www.crypto51.app/ which shows how much it would cost to rent the hashrate from NiceHash, a platform which rents out mining hardware for cloud mining. At one point in time, this website listed an attack on Monero to cost around $6,300 for one hour. While this price may cause many of us to gawk, it’s not outside the realm of possibility for a wealthy business or individual to be able to conduct a sustained attack on the network.</p>\n\n<p>This, thankfully, is no longer the case. A keen eyed reader will see that the website has actually taken Monero off of their application, due to the inclusion of RandomX. Once again, the reader is encouraged to read <a class=\"next-link\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-mining-randomx\" target=\"_blank\">our article on RandomX for details</a>, but due to the CPU-friendly nature of the algorithm, no longer can businesses like NiceHash just purchase ASICs for Monero to rent out to whoever is willing to rent them. Now, they have to compete with CPUs, which are much more prevalent and easier to obtain.</p>\n\n<p>The exact cost of hardware to 51% attack the Monero network has not been calculated, and indeed, is not as easily calculated as other coins with ASICs period.</p>",
	"knowledge.myths.10.title": "Isn’t Monero easily 51% attacked?",
	"knowledge.myths.11.text": "<p>The two boogeymen of the mining space are ASICs and botnets, and moving away from one necessarily means moving closer toward another. If one needs a CPU to mine Monero, then hackers can theoretically take control of many hundreds if not thousands of vulnerable computers and force them to mine Monero on their behalf, costing them nothing, and outcompeting those with only a couple of computers in their households.</p>\n\n<p>The first rebuttal to this argument is about the owners of botnets themselves. While we don’t condone hacking others’ computers, the barrier to entry to owning and operating a botnet is far lower than that of owning ASICs. One requires software – often quite freely available and open source – and the time and an acumen for sniffing out vulnerable computers. The other requires incredible amounts of capital and access to manufacturing. One can be done by a kid in a basement, and the other only by the extremely wealthy. This leads us to conclude that, if the worst fears of miners were to come true, the botnets themselves would be more decentralized than ASICs would be.</p>\n\n<p>That said, the Monero community is confident that this issue is overblown. The engineers of RandomX deliberately designed the protocol to require 2GB of RAM memory to work. In other words, many small, vulnerable virtual private servers (VPS) will simply not have the capacity, and if they did, the uptick in resources used would be very noticeable to a system administrator, leading to immediate investigation. In other words, it can’t run silently in the background like compromised computers taking part in a DDOS attack, or silently sniffing passwords. When the miner is on, everyone knows it.</p>\n\n<p>This reduces the amount of computers a botnet would be able to successfully compromise to those of the greatly technologically inept, or those that are never checked on, rather than the plethora of vulnerable computers that the proponents of this argument assume are at risk.</p>",
	"knowledge.myths.11.title": "CPU-friendly algorithm? Won’t Monero mining just get taken over by botnets?",
	"knowledge.myths.12.text": "<p>This criticism comes from the real-world occurrence. A group of individuals, not known to the community, forked Monero and created their own coin: MoneroV. Since it was a chain fork, individuals were able to claim an equivalent amount of MoneroV as they had in Monero, i.e. if you had 100 Monero, you could use the same seed on a MoneroV wallet to get 100 MoneroV.</p>\n\n<p>This led to a surprising, and unexpected consequence: a loss of privacy. To explain it, we will give an example. If I think of a number that you have to guess, but I give you three numbers, only one of which is correct, you will not know which is the correct answer. Let’s say I tell you the numbers 88, 25, and 19. You are clever however, and ask me for another set of three numbers, but one of them must still be the correct number. I give you 54, 88, and 92. You see that the number 88 appears in both sets, so it must be the correct number, and you would be right.</p>\n\n<p>The attack on Monero’s privacy works the same way. Monero relies on ring signatures, which are assembled on the local wallet to obfuscate transaction outputs. If I was to spend an output on the Monero chain, with one assembled ring, and spend the same output on the MoneroV chain, on a different assembled ring, without making sure that the ring is composed of the same decoys, then the true output becomes obvious, much in the same way the number 88 became obvious as the correct number.</p>\n\n<p>Several solutions were posited, including creating tools for people to fork from Monero responsibly, a blackball database of tainted outputs, and upping the ringsize, but ultimately, none of these were required. MoneroV never gained any traction, and the amount of people who claimed their coins and put their privacy in danger were very few.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that this danger to privacy does NOT come from a code fork of Monero, but rather a chain fork. This means that any coin that takes the code of Monero and starts from scratch with their own genesis block will not put either chain in danger. Only if a coin forks the actual blockchain from the current Monero blockchain because of a disagreement, similar to the Bitcoin / Bitcoin Cash debacle, would the chains be in danger. This would mean the fork would be fighting against the established community, and those that choose not to take part and claim their coins from the other chain would not be in danger.</p>\n\n<p>That said, we do see it as naive to think there will never be an attack on Monero in this way, which is why other solutions are in the works to either increase the ringsize, or move to a different proving scheme altogether, many of which were mentioned in the ‘high transaction fees’ section.</p>",

	"knowledge.myths.13.text": "<p>The history of Monero is an interesting one, and it may surprise many to hear that it did indeed start as a scam. The creator, thankful_for_today, was likely in league with a cryptocurrency group that made the CryptoNote protocol, but had devious intentions to scam people out of their money using it.</p>\n\n<p>Their initial coin efforts failed, so they created Monero as a way to try again. This again failed as the community quickly realized something was amiss and took hold of the coin. Even so, the devious creators had one last trick up their sleeve. They released to the public deliberately deoptimized mining software, keeping the optimized version for themselves so as to outmine others and make lots of money off of the block rewards.</p>\n\n<p>This succeeded for a time, but was also quickly caught by the Monero community, fixed, and the optimized miner was released to all. The community, realizing what happened, chose not to relaunch the coin, as it was difficult to gauge both how much the scammers had made off with, and how much time and effort it would take to rebuild from scratch. Despite the difficulty in ascertaining how many coins the scammers received, it is also known that in this period many good-faith miners had independently re-optimized the code themselves, and sold off their profits, ensuring a more fair distribution, and that the scammers were not the only ones to get a large number of coins in this time. <a class=\"next-link\" href=\"https://da-data.blogspot.com/2014/08/minting-money-with-monero-and-cpu.html\" target=\"_blank\">One such account can be read here</a>.\n\n<p>With the benefit of hindsight, some might criticize the decision to not relaunch the coin, and if these scammy origins are enough to push one away from the good work Monero has done, then there is no argument to sway them. Regardless of the initial frustrations the scammer creators caused, Monero has thrived and used its combined community intellect and passion to make a powerful technology. Our current core team, as well as the past members, were not enriched by the cripple mine, and to our knowledge, nobody involved in the initial scam lasted in the Monero community longer than the first few weeks of the coin’s existence.</p>",

	"knowledge.myths.14.text": "<p>This is a difficult question to answer.

These transactions are transparent, and if we add them up we should get the total number of Monero in circulation.</p>\n\n<p>It’s important to note however, that if shenanigans were to happen that increase the amount of Monero beyond what we expect to see from the coinbase transactions, they would not happen on the coinbase transactions themselves, but in a regular transaction between wallets. This would only happen in one of three ways.</p>\n\n<p>One, if the cryptography that proves no Monero was created or destroyed in a transactions is fundamentally flawed. Two, if the implementation (code) of the solid cryptography is flawed. Three, if neither is flawed, but computers become powerful enough to punch through our current cryptographic schemes, and create false proofs.</p>",

	"knowledge.myths.15.text": "<p>This one is the most difficult to answer because of the constant fluctuation of mining in general. In fact, it may be that after this article is published this may not be the case anymore, and the next day it may become the case again. Technology in general is hard to write about definitively due to the fast moving nature of the industry, and this is especially true with mining and hashrate.</p>\n\n<p>We’re not avoiding the concern, don’t worry. Let’s address it by looking at the difference between hardware centralization and pool centralization.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that mining on Bitcoin can only be done on very specific hardware that is not easily accessible means that the best hardware is centralized around the manufactures. Since setting up a mining pool is trivial, we expect to see these manufacturers deploy their own mining pools, on which their ASICs mine, and indeed, we see this to be the case with the major ASIC manufacturing companies today.<p>\n\n<p>This is not a solvable problem. The centralized mining pools own the hardware, the pool, and the hashes, and there is nothing that anyone can do about it.</p>\n\n<p>Pool centralization, while the end result is similar, has very different, and much more changeable underpinnings. Because Monero has egalitarian mining, every miner can choose where to point their hashes. People often choose to point at a bigger pool, simply because this means they will see blocks found more often than a smaller pool. </p>\n\n<p>Although, it should be noted that their individual cut of the block reward will be smaller since they are sharing it with many more people. Smaller pools find blocks less often, but each miner gets a larger portion of the block reward, and the end result is a miner actually makes an equivalent amount of money whether they are on a smaller pool or larger one, so we encourage miners to point their hash to smaller pools to further decentralize the mining.</p>\n\n<p>But we digress.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll notice in our encouragement for decentralization above, the fact that the miner has the power to switch pools. At any point, whether from better education, a rallying call for decentralization, or increased competition amongst pools, the hash distribution can change based off of individual miners changing where they point their hashes. The same can’t be said for mining that is centralized on the hardware level, as the ASIC manufacturers have no incentive to point to any pool other than their own, and they will not do so.</p>\n\n<p>So that fact that the bulk of Monero’s hashrate is concentrated into a couple of pools is not something we are stuck with, and indeed, may be due to lack of education about mining in general. It’s something that can be fixed because the problem does not lie at the root level, unlike with Bitcoin’s hardware centralization.</p>",
	"knowledge.myths.15.title": "Most of Monero’s current hashrate comes from just two pools.",
	"knowledge.myths.2.text": "<p>Monero does indeed have fewer wallet options than many existing coins. This is because Monero was developed from the ground up. It’s on a completely different codebase than Bitcoin. This means Monero can’t just fork the Bitcoin core wallet, or any other wallets that exist for Bitcoin like most coins do, and take advantage of existing infrastructure. As well, it means that Monero is not as easily added to third party wallets, such as Exodus.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, slowly but surely, wallets of all kinds are beginning to appear for Monero. It was a meme for many years that Monero did not have a GUI, and no mobile wallet support, but now, nothing could be further from the truth. There are wallets that cater to Monero specifically, such as Monerujo for Android, and Cake Wallet for both iOS and Android, as well as new ones such as Wookey, Exa Wallet, and more. Furthermore, third party wallets are beginning to add Monero, albeit at a slower rate, including Exodus and Guarda, and we expect this trend to only continue as time goes on and Monero’s codebase matures.</p>",
	"knowledge.myths.2.title": "Monero has fewer wallet options.",
	"knowledge.myths.3.text": "<p>This criticism is also a bit of a tricky one. Admittedly, in some areas, Monero is indeed more difficult to use than Bitcoin. Examples of this are in the longer address, and syncing taking a long time, even on a light wallet, because a wallet cannot simply check the blockchain without scanning each output to see if it belongs to the account in question. </p>\n\n<p>That said, in many ways, Monero builds on, if not outright improves, the user experience of cryptocurrency, particularly when it comes to privacy.</p>\n\n<p>We invite the reader to read articles on the steps Bitcoiners recommend for maintaining privacy. The list is long, confusing, and difficult to get perfectly, with often the consequences for a mistake being compromised privacy. One example of this is the suggestion to tumble or mix your Bitcoin, but after the mixing process, if the resulting outputs are merged or otherwise move into the same wallet, the mixing could have been for naught, as tracing the outputs provide high linkability. Another example is the fact that many recommend mining your own Bitcoin if you want it to remain completely ambiguous as to how the Bitcoin outputs were obtained, a notion which is laughable in the current mining ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>With Monero, this laundry list of details are all but completely done away with. Every Monero transaction retains a high level of privacy every time, without the user needing to do anything or use external software. While Bitcoin makes it difficult to get privacy right for all except the most experienced user, Monero makes it difficult to get it wrong, for everyone, all the time. As far as trade-offs go, we think the longer addresses and sync time are more than worth it.</p>\n\n<p>And even after discussing everything above, the fact remains that user experience often gets better over time, and Monero is no exception. The UX of a coin may be dramatically improved after a few years, but the foundations of it are much harder to change.</p>",
	"knowledge.myths.3.title": "Monero has a poor user experience.",
	"knowledge.myths.4.text": "<p>This criticism is most commonly given with Bitcoin in mind. What if Bitcoin adopts privacy technologies that allow adequate privacy. What would be the use for Monero?</p>\n\n<p>The reality is, we don’t see Bitcoin ever putting privacy on the first layer. At best, it would be on second layers, or through certain wallets, such as Samourai and Wasabi. This means the privacy is opt-in, which research shows is always inferior to privacy that is on by default. Even if this technology was adopted by a decent percentage of Bitcoin users (which is itself a stretch of the imagination), the privacy would be inferior.</p>\n\n<p>While the reasons for opt-in privacy inferiority would be big enough to make it’s own article, we want to elaborate with a crude example here. Privacy, from a technological standpoint, is about hiding in a crowd. The bigger and more homogeneous the crowd, the better the privacy of the individual. Conversely if either the crowd is small, or large, but everyone wears different, unique clothing, it would be easier to identify an individual.</p>\n\n<p>This means that since Bitcoin is forcing people to take extra steps to be a part of this crowd, many will not do it, and those that do, may do it poorly. The end result ends up being a small crowd, and identifying individual outputs is much easier. But it gets worse. In addition to the crowd being small, every individual is more or less unique from each other, depending on the privacy protocol they chose to use. Some might choose Samourai, which has one way of mixing, while others may choose Wasabi which has another, and the list goes on. This ultimately leads to unique characteristics about each transaction. Coupled with the small crowd, the privacy is quite weak.</p>\n\n<p>We compare the above to Monero, which enforces privacy at a protocol level. This means that everyone is a part of the crowd by default, and everyone utilizes the same privacy (the one dictated by the protocol). The crowd is both large, and homogeneous, resulting in much stronger privacy.</p>\n\n<p>But let’s take a step back and follow a hypothetical, where, somehow, Bitcoin does indeed put privacy on the base layer. It’s robust, on-by default, and mandatory. What would be the need for Monero?</p>\n\n<p>Well, for some, there wouldn’t be one, and it may be surprising to hear, but many of us Monero folks wouldn’t care. All we want is for there to be a privacy preserving, fungible way for individuals to transact with each other across the globe, and if Bitcoin miraculously does it in a way that actually protects privacy through mandatory, base-layer technology, then many of us would happily switch over. Good luck getting this to happen though.</p>\n\n<p>That said, Monero does offer many features beyond privacy that Bitcoin does not. The dynamic blocksize enabled by a tail emission, a different code base, a policy of low fees, a different elliptic curve, and more. In particular the dynamic blocksize should be highlighted here, as it enables a theoretically limitless transaction throughput with only storage and bandwidth being the choke points. In short, a theoretical Bitcoin with privacy just doesn't offer everything Monero does.</p>\n\n<p>Switching gears one last time for this question, less often this argument applies to technology like an ethereum smart contract using zk-SNARKS, which, once again, does not have mandatory privacy on the base layer of the main chain, so the anonymity sets will be quite small and of dubious ability to adequately protect privacy.

The printer analogy in our <a class=\"next-link\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-mining-randomx\" target=\"_blank\">article on mining in Monero</a> explains how this works.</p>\n\n<p>What most people don't know is that Monero's hard forks did not begin for the reasons of changing its proof-of-work. Monero had been hard forking every six months prior to this as well, going back as far as 2015. Why do these hard forks in the first place? Ask any person that works on privacy and they will tell you that privacy is an arms race. One side makes good privacy, the other develops tools that can break said privacy, causing the first side to develop stronger technology, and the cycle goes on and on.</p>\n\n<p>A major example of pre-PoW change hard forks is the inclusion of RingCT in 2017, arguably the biggest changes to Monero ever that increased Monero's privacy by many orders of magnitude.

And on the proof-of-work front several community members created RandomX as a last gambit to keep ASICs off of the network.

As explored in our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/ring-signatures\" class=\"next-link\">ring signatures article</a>, outputs are the actual unit exchanged on the blockchain between transacting parties. Similar to a dollar bill, but the amount is not in a fixed denomination.</p>\n\n<p>If you get paid $16 for a job, you might receive a one dollar bill, a five dollar bill, and a ten dollar bill. You have $16, but you also have three different bills in your wallet. If you wanted to pay someone 6 dollars, you could use the 5 and the 1 bill, but if you wanted to pay someone $8 you could only use the $10 and receive $2 back in change. Lastly, if you wanted to pay someone $14 you would have to use all three bills, and would receive $2 back in change, but for a moment, when you hand over all three bills, you have no money in your wallet until you get the change back.</p>\n\n<p>Monero works similarly. Suppose you run a store and make three sales on three different items. You might receive 1.5 XMR, 2.25 XMR, and 5.25 XMR for a total of 9 XMR, but you also have three different outputs in your wallet of the denominations stated previously. Just like with the dollars, you might want to pay someone 3 XMR. You could use just the 5.25 XMR output, and receive 1.75 XMR back in change, or you could combine the 1.5 and 2.25 XMR outputs and get 0.75 XMR back in change.</p>\n\n<p>But, as soon as you send the transaction, the outputs that you do use are put in a \"locked\" state, meaning they are inaccessible until you receive back the change. The protocol unlocks the funds (i.e. gives you back the change) after 10 confirmations, or around 20 minutes. Just like once you hand over the dollar bills out of your wallet, you cannot use the money again until you receive the change back from the cashier, your Monero is inaccessible until you receive back the change.</p>\n\n<p>Let's go back to the example of sending 3 XMR to someone, and you use the 5.25 XMR output. Now, while you wait for you 1.75 XMR back in change, you cannot use it. This 1.75 XMR is inaccessible to you. But you can still use the 1.5 XMR and 2.25 XMR outputs, as these were not spent. Going back to the dollar example, if you paid someone $8, as in the example before, you would not be able to use the $2 that you expect back in change until it is given to you, but in this example, you still have a $10 bill that is unused in your wallet. This can still be used to purchase whatever you want while you wait for the change. The same with Monero.</p>\n\n<p>This is often a point of confusion for new Monero users. Often, a user may just have one output in their wallet, received from an exchange or a friend. Let's say this output is 20 XMR. They have no other outputs in their wallet. They now want to make a donation to two of their favorite charities. They send 5 XMR to the first charity and then are confused because, even though they should have 15 XMR left, they cannot immediately send the next donation to the second charity. As you might have guessed, this is because the 15 XMR is locked. It cannot be spent until it is returned as change (10 confirmations or around 20 minutes). After their funds are unlocked, they would be able to send their second donation.</p>\n\n<p>Just to reiterate the point, they would not have had this problem if they had had multiple outputs instead, such as two 10 XMR outputs or similar. They would be able to send both donations one right after the other, because the first donation would use one of the 10 XMR outputs (and wait 10 confirmations to receive 5 XMR back in change), and the second donation would use the other 10 XMR output.</p>\n\n<p>Some cryptocurrency wallets have a feature called ‘output management’, which simply shows a user which outputs they currently have (in addition to their total sum), as well as allows them to choose which ones they want to use when they spend their cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n<p>As of now, the Monero GUI does output selection for users automatically, as users selecting their own outputs often leads to confusion or, in some cases, harmed privacy. There are wallets under construction however, such as the new Feather wallet project, that will contain these output management features.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve been talking a lot about the sending portion, but something fascinating happens on the receiving end. Going back to our example of sending 3 XMR to someone, and using your 1.5 XMR and 2.25 XMR outputs in the transaction (while expecting 0.75 XMR in change), the receiver does NOT receive two outputs of 1.5 XMR and 2.25 XMR. They instead receive ONE 3 XMR output.</p>\n\n<p>In the background, the protocol combines all outputs used for spending, and gives the receiver one output of the paid amount, and sends one change output back to the sender. So the sender will also receive one output back as change, regardless of whether they used two, three, or ten outputs to send the transaction.</p>\n\n<p>We hope this has cleared up some confusion about outputs and how the internal accounting of the protocol works, as well as the common user facing problem of confusion when encountering locked funds. In another article, we will explore managing your outputs so as to minimize the chance of having to wait for unlocked funds before sending future transactions.</p>",

	"knowledge.practices.5.text": "<p>In the realm of privacy, it's often far too easy to accidentally leak or reveal data about yourself that can be used to identify you. An old example that no longer applies to Monero is custom ringsizes. If the default is 11, and everyone uses 11, but you consistently use 54, yes the number is higher so your anonymity set is higher, but now you stand apart from the crowd and your transactions are easier to identify. Monero has since made an update to fix the ringsize at 11, so now everyone looks the same.</p>\n\n<p>There are several things one can do to accidentally harm their privacy in other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Choosing a reputable mixer, getting non-KYC/AML'd coins, not reusing addresses, and proper coin output management are all things an individual needs to consider when trying to minimize leakage of metadata. Monero sidesteps many of these problems by making the privacy features mandatory, and setting good defaults for the average user. The example above of using a fixed ringsize means that end users don't have to puzzle over how to achieve the best possible privacy in this regard. The wallet does it for them automatically.</p>\n\n<p>This may seem like an odd thing to talk about. Most users could be forgiven for thinking that all software automatically works for them, and not against them. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth, and when it comes to privacy almost all cryptocurrencies are severely lacking. The amount of effort one has to go through to achieve any level of privacy is usually too much and too difficult for an average user. This is often the case even with other cryptocurrencies that focus on privacy! Monero makes sure to make it so privacy happens automatically, with no thought from users, at the protocol level when possible, and with sane default settings for the wallets when it's not.

	"knowledge.ringct.0.text": "<p>Monero’s privacy does not depend on one singular mechanism that, if broken, would reveal the entirety of transactions, but rather three different technologies that work in tandem to provide holistic privacy while compensating for the weaknesses of the other parts. This three-prong approach consists of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/ring-signatures\" class=\"next-link\">ring signatures</a, RingCT, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-stealth-addresses\" class=\"next-link\">stealth addresses</a>. These three technologies hide the real output (sender), amount, and receiver respectively. Today we’ll be talking about RingCT.</p>\n\n<p>RingCT is arguably the most technical of the three, and can be difficult to understand, so we won’t be covering how it works exactly, but rather showing how it is possible to not know an amount and still confirm things about it. And don’t worry, we’ll use plenty of examples as always.</p>\n\n<p>First, let’s explore why it’s important to verify anything about the amounts. Why can’t we just keep them completely secret? The answer is, there are clever ways that people can create money from thin air if given the opportunity. How might something like this work? Let’s look at an example.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to purchase an item from your friend, and he wants ten dollars for it, then you start with ten dollars and he starts with zero. After you give him the ten dollars, he has ten dollars and you have zero. You started with ten, and now he has ten. No money was created or destroyed in this transaction.</p>\n\n<p>With cryptocurrencies, a clever individual can give ten dollars for the item and instead of receiving zero dollars in change, they can receive two dollars back. Instead of 0 and 10 leading to 10 and 0 (or 10=10), it’s now 0 and 10 leads to 10 and 2 (or 10=12). Two Monero was just created out of thin air. You can imagine that if the individual was to do this to themselves several times, they would be able to amass a gigantic fortune in short order.</p>\n\n<p>With Bitcoin and others, this would be easy to see. You look at the inputs going into a transactions and the outputs coming out and make sure that what is sent equals what is received. If these amounts were encrypted and not visible then a user has no way of verifying that what is sent and what is received is the same.</p>\n\n<p>In an attempt to increase Bitcoin privacy, Gregory Maxwell created Confidential Transactions (CT), a new technology that would allow for encrypted amounts, while proving that nothing was created or destroyed in the process. As with most privacy technology, it did not make it into Bitcoin, but Monero was keen on adopting it. There was just one problem. The already implemented technology of ring signatures was incompatible with the proposed idea. So, one of the MRL researchers at the time, Shen Noether, modified CT into RingCT, a version of CT that was compatible with ring signatures.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, the way this works is quite technical, and would be difficult to explain in an introductory article. For the cryptography enthusiast who simply must know, there are plenty of in-depth articles written on the internet about the inner workings of CT. For the rest of us, this article will show how it might be possible to hide the amounts, but still prove that nothing was created or destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s say Alice wanted to send Bob money. Alice will send 10 XMR to Bob, who will receive 10 XMR. 10=10 so nothing is wrong here. But Alice doesn’t want anyone to know how much she is sending. So she and Bob create a shared secret. Basically a number that only the two of them know. Let’s say that number is 22. Now, Alice multiplies 10 (what she is really sending) by 22 to get 220. This is the number she shares with the network.</p>\n\n<p>The miners themselves don't know the secret number. If they did, they could divide the number they are shown by the secret number and get the real amount sent. But since they don’t, they can’t. They do see that Bob will receive 220 though. 220 sent. 220 received. 220 = 220. In this way, the network can verify that no Monero was created or destroyed, all without knowing the real amount that Alice sent Bob.</p>\n\n<p>Since Bob knows the shared secret number, when he receives the money, he just divides by 22 to get the real amount that Alice sent, 10. Alice and Bob both know how much was sent and how much was received, all while everyone else is given a false number.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, this is not the actual way in which CT works, but it gives an idea of how something like this might be possible. The real way involves things like Pedersen commitments, two sent amounts (one encrypted amount to the receiver and one commitment amount to the network), and…yeah, it’s already easy to see how one could get lost in all that.</p>\n\n<p>One thing to note however, is that while RingCT does hide the amount transacted between two parties in a transaction, it does not hide two other sets of numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The first is the coinbase transactions. If this term is unfamiliar to you, it basically means the reward that miners get for finding the next block. This number is not hidden. Anyone can see how much the protocol has awarded a miner for their service. In this way, the current amount of Monero in existence can be known by adding up all of the coinbase transactions. Their sum will equal the current Monero in circulation.</p>\n\n<p>The second number not hidden is the fee paid to the miners when a user sends a transaction. The fees have to be in the clear so miners can know who to prioritize. This is a way that users can hurt their privacy however, as if someone uses a unique miner fee each time they send a transaction (like 0.12345), then their transactions can be linked.</p>\n\n<p>Other than these cases, RingCT has been hiding Monero amounts since 2017, and our collective privacy is all the stronger for it.</p>",

	"knowledge.ringct.title": "How RingCT Hides Monero Transaction Amounts",
	"knowledge.rings.0.text": "<p>Monero is known far and wide across the crypto space as being the king of privacy coins. While everyone knows Monero offers good privacy, not as many understand just how the privacy operates.</p>\n\n<p>Many other privacy coins publish comparison chart infographics, which list off the names of each coin’s privacy technology, and in most they label Monero’s tech as RingCT, but this is only partially true. Monero actually has a three-prong approach to privacy. One technology to hide the receiver of a transaction, one to hide the amount sent, and one to hide the output used, these are stealth addresses, RingCT, and ring signatures respectively.</p>\n\n<p>This three-pronged approach means that if one of the technologies is broken, the others do not necessarily share the same fate. Ring signatures are the weakest link in the privacy scheme; the word weak here meaning the most susceptible to heuristic attacks. Let’s take some time to explore them, shall we?</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, the goal of ring signatures is to obscure an output used in a transaction. If the 'input/output' terminology of cryptocurrency is confusing to you, don’t worry. It’s actually not that complicated. When you hear 'output' just think a check. One of those things, not quite so common anymore, that people use to pay with. Like a check, it can be denoted in any amount - $10, $32.50, etc - and is exchanged between transacting parties. For cryptocurrencies, outputs serve these functions.</p>\n\n<p>When someone pays you 10 Monero, you receive a 10 XMR output. This output has a value (10), and is what is taken from the sender’s wallet, in the same way when you pay for a service, a bill leaves your physical wallet and is given to the person you are purchasing from.</p>\n\n<p>The way the output is hidden is by constructing a ring (hence the name) of decoy outputs. But these decoys are not 'fake' outputs’. They are real past outputs from the blockchain that have nothing to do with the present transaction, but to an outside observer, each of these outputs might look equally probable as the real one. The size of the set of decoy outputs, plus the real one is called the ringsize, and currently Monero’s is eleven. So there are ten decoy outputs and one real one.</p>\n\n<p>Why don’t we just increase this number to 100 or even 1000? The more the better, right? Well, from a privacy perspective, yes, but there are other things to consider. Let’s go back to a physical example to see what I mean. If you wanted to hide one of your dollar bills among ten decoys, you would need to carry around eleven dollars in your wallet for each dollar you wanted to spend. One real dollar, and ten fake ones. This already gets pretty cumbersome if you want to spend even a few dollars. Now imagine we increased the decoy amount to 1000. For every one dollar you wanted to spend, you would need to carry around 1001 dollars. You’d need to carry around a briefcase just to buy one candy bar! It's important to note that ring signatures don't work quite this way, for example, the decoys themselves are not a part of the signature, only references to them, but we hope this analogy can be somewhat helpful in picturing the basic concepts.</p>\n\n<p>The decoys on the blockchain work similarly. Each added decoy increases the time and verification cost of the transaction. Every node has to download the entire ring signature for each transaction, and each ring signature contains the real output, as well as the decoys. Not only that, but it has to verify the math that at least one of these outputs is real, and the math verification time also increases with each decoy. This means we have to find a happy middle ground, where the ringsize is large enough to adequately obscure the real output, even against many heuristic attacks, but small enough so as not to cause the blockchain to increase at a massive rate. It’s not enough to pick an arbitrary number, or to just increase the ringsize when we make the signature smaller (such as with CLSAG). The Monero community wants concrete, mathematical evidence on which ringsize offer the best trade offs. A number too small, and the privacy will not be strong enough against heuristic attacks. Too large, and we may be getting only marginal benefit on the privacy side, and needlessly suffering in regards to scaling.</p>\n\n<p>One last thing to mention. Some Monero literature simplifies and says that ring signatures hide the sender, but this is not entirely true, and the difference is not just pedantic. The difference between the sender (a human) and an output (a bill) is a big one when it comes to preserving privacy. While an output may have ties to a sender, an output itself does not equal a sender. So even if a ring signature was to be broken, it does not necessarily link to a person’s identity, and both the amount and the receiver are still hidden, minimizing the damage done to the privacy of all parties.</p>\n\n<p>That’s not to say that a broken ring signature is insignificant. Any leaked metadata is bad, and does have the potential to reveal more information than we think, especially when used in conjunction with other metadata. So we do our best to ensure that the ringsize chosen has academic rigor behind the decision, other metadata leakage is minimized, and the user experiences defaults to the best possible actions.</p>\n\n<p>But if the probability of a broken signature is still worrying to you, well, there is some incredible news on the horizon. The next generation of privacy protocols that are being worked on, such as Triptych, Arcturus, and Lelantus, have really neat capabilities. In these protocols, the size scales logarithmically, not linearly, as ringsize increases. This means that we can fit 100 decoys, but the space used is closer to ringsize 10 in the old tech. That’s quite the difference, and will significantly improve privacy all around.</p>\n\n<p>In the cat and mouse game that is privacy, Monero continuously innovates to stay ahead of the curve and ensure the best practical privacy for all.<p>",

	"knowledge.stealth.0.text": "<p>Monero has implemented a three-prong approach to privacy. These technologies are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/ring-signatures\" class=\"next-link\">ring signatures</a>, which hide the true output (sender), RingCT which hides the amounts, and stealth addresses, which hides the receiver. Today, we will be discussing the last of these mentioned technologies: stealth addresses.</p>\n\n<p>There are many reasons why an individual might want to hide who they are sending to. We must never let anyone try to convince us that all examples of this are unsavory behaviors. Things like sending to a unpopular political party, donating to charities, or supporting those that the culture deems 'cancelled' are all examples of where one might want to hide their spending behaviors for fear of repercussion, but are perfectly legitimate in nature.</p>\n\n<p>On a transparent blockchain, the addresses where one sends their transactions to are visible to all. It's important to consider that if miners themselves disagree with where the money is going, they can choose not to mine it into a block, effectively censoring this transaction on a seemingly censorship resistant platform. The only way to make this, admittedly unlikely, censorship not possible is if miners can't distinguish between transactions because all on-chain metadata is obscured by various means. Something that Monero is known for.</p>\n\n<p>Monero solves this problem of transparent addresses by implementing stealth addresses, a technology that was actually initially made for Bitcoin in 2011 by Bitcoin Talk forum user ByteCoin (the relation to Bytecoin, which would later integrate stealth addresses, is unknown). The current form of stealth addresses has several improvements over the initial idea however. But first, in order to see how they work, let's talk about keys.</p>\n\n<p>It's hard to be in the cryptocurrency space and not hear about keys. Phrases like 'back up your private key' are common, but when an average Joe hears the words \"public key\" and \"private key\" they get scared and think it will be too technical and confusing to understand. But don't worry. We'll take it slow, and use plenty of examples.</p>\n\n<p>The two kinds of keys used in cryptocurrencies are, as just mentioned, public and private. These two keys usually come in a pair, meaning that a particular public and private key are linked to one another. In fact, usually the public key is derived from the private one, meaning if you know the private key, your wallet can do some nifty math and come up with the correct public key every time.</p> \n\n<p>Now, as the names imply, the public key can be public without consequence. Usually it's a part of the address that you share to receive money into your cryptocurrency wallet. Also following its namesake, the private key is one that should not be shared. It's the thing that allows you to sign and spend a transaction, so if it is stolen or shared, then the dastardly third party can spend your money, usually to themselves.</p>\n\n<p>An easy analogy to this would be a padlock and the key needed to unlock it. The open padlock can be shared freely, and indeed anything can be locked up with this padlock, but only the person with the key is able to open anything the padlock is closed on. The padlock can be copied and shared, the key should not be.</p>\n\n<p>These keys are usually abstracted away from the user, so you never really see them. In Monero, they don't appear as a scary alphanumeric string at all. In Monero, the common user knows the private key as their seed. The seed (that you should write down if you haven't), is actually just a human readable private key. </p>\n\n<p>See? Not so scary after all. Back to stealth addresses.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned before, stealth addresses weren't originally made for Monero, but Bitcoin. As with most fledgling ideas though, this first iteration had issues. The next attempt came when CryptoNote was created by Nicholas van Saberhagan for Bytecoin, the precursor to Monero (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-history\" class=\"next-link\">see our history of Monero and Bytecoin here</a>), and while it was a definite improvement over the original, even it had some subtle flaws.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, one last iteration came into being from a developer for another now-defunct, privacy cryptocurrency, which fixed the outstanding privacy and security issues with the idea. This eventually made its way into Monero, and is what is used today.</p> \n\n<p>Although these privacy and security issues were solved, stealth addresses themselves added a different kind of quirk to blockchain technologies, one that didn’t exist before. The need to scan. Since receiving addresses are not publicly displayed on the blockchain, the receiver never knows if any given transaction is theirs, so they must scan every incoming transactions with their private key to see if it’s theirs.</p>\n\n<p>With transparency coins, all they have to do is check to see if a transaction is sending to your address. An easy yes or no question. But with stealth addresses, every transaction could potentially be one that is being sent to you, so you have to try to unlock each one with your private key to see if it opens.</p> \n\n<p>This is an extra step that Bitcoin and its derivatives do not have, and makes initial wallet setup, along with syncing a wallet when you haven’t opened it for a while, much longer than Bitcoin. The tradeoff is necessary though, to unlock the privacy guarantees it has. It should be noted that, unlike the weakest point of the privacy trifecta, ring signatures, stealth addresses is not susceptible to heuristics. It relies on tried and true elliptic curve cryptography, which the entire internet relies on, so breaking it would mean an end to computer security in general, not just Monero.</p> ",

	"knowledge.subaddresses.0.text": "<p>Monero has always found innovative ways to solve difficult privacy problems. Often times these innovations lead to other innovations, and sometimes these resulting technologies can even be used for usecases not previously considered. Nowhere is this exemplified more than in the case of Monero's subaddress technology.</p>\n\n<p>Consider a hypothetical privacy problem, wherein usage of one address across multiple platforms from seemingly unrelated peoples can lead to the linkage and deanonymization of said peoples. Put simply, if you were a person named Billy Joe Bob and you sold apples for Bitcoin, you might post your Bitcoin address in a public place for customers to pay you. Let's say the address starts with the alphanumeric string 7XybV3... But tossing aside the obvious privacy risk of anyone being able to check your Bitcoin balance and see how much you have sold, there's a second, not often talked about privacy risk. Let's say you were also an underground hacker going by the name of l33tz0r. You do whistle blowing work, telling an unsuspecting populace about government corruption, and it's imperative that you keep your identity a secret. You accept Bitcoin donations for your work, and post the address on a public forum. It's the same address that you accept money from your apple customers. The 7XybV3... one.</p>\n\n<p>A simple, but devastating deanonymization attack would be to use an internet search engine to search for your Bitcoin address. Putting the address of 7XybV3... in the engine brings up two different results. The apple business, and l33tz0r. This is enough to link the two identities and deanonymize l33tz0r, with potentially scary consequences from the powers that be.</p>\n\n<p>It's important to note that this attack is ALSO possible with Monero. Even though Monero hides most on-chain data, this attack doesn't use any. It only uses the address, which must be shared in order to receive payment. Publicly in the case of anonymous donations. This is one potential way in which Monero users can unwittingly hurt their privacy, and is also an example of how, even though Monero is top tier in regards to privacy retention, it is not bulletproof.</p>\n\n<p>The usual way of getting around this problem was owning multiple wallets. With different addresses posted for every identity (or usecase), they cannot be linked. But this privacy only holds if the user never mixes them up. Accidentally posting the incorrect address would have the same linkage effects. As well, the seed of each address must be kept secure, increasing the infosec work necessary with each new wallet made.</p>\n\n<p>Monero's solution was subaddresses. The ability to create an absolutely massive number of addresses underneath the main address, using it as a seed of sorts. Every generated subaddress can accept Monero, and all of it goes to the same wallet. Using this method, the number of identities that can be operated under one address is huge while keeping the infosec work to a minimum. These addresses are also not mathematically linkable, so unless the user shouts their connection to the world, an outside observer will have great difficulty linking them.</p>\n\n<p>But another interesting usecase emerged from subaddresses; as a replacement option of the universally hated payment IDs.</p>\n\n<p>Payment IDs were a way for merchants to identify which customer sent which payment. Since Monero information is obscured on chain, the receiver of a transaction is not able to see which address sent it. This means that if there are similarly priced items and multiple orders, it can become impossible to identify who sent what. Payment IDs are a unique, random string generated by the merchant and given to the customer. The customer adds this as a separate field when sending the transaction. This random string is placed on the blockchain as part of the transaction, and in this way, the merchant is able to identify and sort through incoming transactions.</p>\n\n<p>This method was flawed in several ways. Firstly, it detracts from the uniformity of on-chain data. Additional, unique metadata can make some transactions stand apart from the crowd, thereby allowing heuristic analysis. This is especially true when this metadata is not enforced as mandatory for all. Making this mandatory for everyone would add needless space to the blockchain though, and was not pursued. As well, if a payment ID was ever reused for any reason, it would be trivial to link two transactions as connected. This typically occurred with exchange deposits, and anyone could easily link transactions as both being a deposit on an exchange, and from one particular individual.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, from a UX perspective, payment IDs create a second step that cryptocurrency users coming from other coins are not used to, and if they are forgotten then it causes a massive headache to the merchant who must identify these transactions via other means. This was typically done by speaking directly with each customer who forgot to put the payment ID and confirming other identifying information that only they could know, such as a combination of the amount, date sent, and transaction ID.</p>\n\n<p>This extra step was missed by many, and it got to the point where some exchanges started to charge money to customers if their money had to be manually retrieved because of forgetting a payment ID. Others grit their teeth and ate the extra support costs, but nobody was happy about it.</p>\n\n<p>There was one solution to this, integrated addresses, which merged the address and the payment ID into one string, so it couldn’t be forgotten, but adoption was fairly weak, despite the benefits merchants would have received from including it.</p>\n\n<p>In an interesting turn of events, subaddresses came in to save the day. The ability to generate large amounts of subaddresses per main address, and identify which transactions came into which subaddresses, allowed merchants to rid themselves of payment IDs in an elegant way, while adopting the next generation of Monero technology. Since then, most exchanges and merchant tools have switched to subaddresses as the primary way of transaction identification.</p>\n\n<p>What started as a solution for a privacy problem turned into something much more, which solved a major UX issue for merchants and customers alike. Innovation begets more innovation, which can often snowball into unexpected wins for everyone. Monero has seen this time and time again, and puts great effort into innovating what is possible on the blockchain. Who knows what other things we can unlock together?</p>",

	"knowledge.wired.0.text": "<p>In both the privacy and cryptocurrency spheres, misinformation often runs rampant. We have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-myths-debunked\" class=\"next-link\">an article outlining fifteen common incorrect or outdated assumptions about Monero</a>, but we want to take time to address one particular article that is often cited and circulated by Monero skeptics.</p>\n\n<p>The Wired publication put out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/monero-privacy/\" class=\"next-link\">an article</a> on the 27th of March, 2018, which itself was written in response to another fresh-off-the-press paper published by various academics titled: “An Empirical Analysis of Traceability in the Monero Blockchain”.</p>\n\n<p>Though the paper was coauthored by individuals with clear conflict of interest (read: they are advisors to, and have a stake in Zcash), the paper was moderately well-received by the Monero community as confirming things the community has already known and written about in their own Monero Research Lab papers (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://web.getmonero.org/resources/research-lab/pubs/MRL-0001.pdf\" class=\"next-link\">MRL-0001</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://web.getmonero.org/resources/research-lab/pubs/MRL-0004.pdf\" class=\"next-link\">MRL-0004</a>) the earliest of which was published four years prior. There were also several frustrations with it however, chiefly the conflict of interest, the fact that the issues were already known, discussed and – in some cases – remedied, and the gross mischaracterization of Monero’s privacy guarantees at the time. The community commented on the preprint of the work, and many of their recommendations made it through to the final paper.</p>\n\n<p>But what exactly was mischaracterized? The fact that Monero had not had the flaws discussed in the paper for over a year. Transactions pre-2017 were indeed vulnerable to a form of privacy leakage, but at the time of publishing, Monero had addressed most of the concerns. To be fair to the authors, they discuss Monero’s remedies to a small degree, but not enough to influence the effect it had on the cryptocurrency media cycle at the time. Hence the Wired article.</p>\n\n<p>While we can examine the Wired article in question as a period piece, and how true or untrue it was at the time, the fact that it is still being shared today as reasoning for why Monero’s privacy guarantees are weak actually invite an analysis on how the piece holds up in the present. We gladly take this invitation.</p>\n\n<p>A quick read of the article shows several sensationalized lines, such as “[The findings] shouldn’t just worry anyone trying to stealthily spend Monero today” and the entire tone of the article which postulates the research as ‘new’, based largely off of the publication. The academic paper itself has recommendations such as warning Monero users of the potential compromise of their anonymity, despite the fact that not only had these discussions been happening since 2014, but the rallying cry of the community was for people to not buy Monero and that it was very experimental.</p>\n\n<p>But what of the criticisms themselves? The reality is that many issues with Monero as a privacy coin are either no longer true of Monero, or shared concerns with privacy coins as a category of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. Let’s begin addressing these.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most often-quoted criticisms of Monero is that, because of the permanence and immutability of the blockchain, if a future technology was to break the privacy, all of Monero’s past transactions would be laid bare. In other words, your privacy has a ticking clock on it.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot stress this enough. Literally every privacy coin that employs on-chain methods for obfuscation and privacy has this flaw, and yet it is often used against Monero (ironically, many times by competing privacy coins with the same problem), and is used in this article as well. The response to this criticism might be surprising to some, but Monero actually may be less vulnerable than other privacy coins to this due to the fact that it has a multi-pronged approach to privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Monero hides outputs (senders), amounts, and receivers through three different technologies, ring signatures, RingCT, and stealth addresses respectively. Of these, ring signatures are the weakest, and most susceptible to both modern day heuristics and theoretical, future, privacy-breaking technologies. This has been known to the Monero community for years, and active research is underway to improve or replace the ring signature scheme entirely.</p>\n\n<p>However, even if the ring signature was broken entirely, only the true output would be revealed. NOT the sender (as in individual), but the output. To couple an output with an identity is not impossible, but it would require more metadata and resources. Coupled with the fact that RingCT and the stealth address would NOT be revealed lessens the impact even further.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that the Wired article does lightly discuss the above information in the portion where they reached out to Riccardo ‘fluffypony’ Spagni for comment, but the time given to it is brief, and almost seems to hand-wave away this crucial information. The lack of understanding is especially apparent when trying to discuss these things with people who share the article willy-nilly in the modern day.</p>\n\n<p>Another criticism that’s much harder to address is in how the outside world views Monero, and how that relates with how the community around Monero views the coin. For an example of this, readers need not look farther than the title of the article itself: “The Dark Web’s Favorite Currency Is Less Untraceable Than It Seems”.</p>\n\n<p>Any person who spends any significant amount of time in the Monero community can attest to the fact that the Monero community goes to great lengths to show just how hard real privacy is to achieve, even to the detriment of marketing or adoption efforts. If the community provides ample resources discussing the coin and its shortcomings accurately, at some point, the ignorance becomes the fault of the user who believes that the coin is all they need to be 100% private.</p>\n\n<p>By this point it should be evident that the Monero community takes seriously both its privacy, and its honesty about the weaknesses therein and subsequent improvements. Articles, like the one in question, completely miss this spirit of innovation in Monero. It likens Monero to the droves of other cryptocurrencies that make grandiose claims, with only thought for profit and to prey on uneducated investor-wannabes.</p>\n\n<p>The reality couldn’t be more different. Monero is acutely aware of its weaknesses, seeks to continue building so as to improve them, tighten up loose joints, and achieve the very real, but very hard goal of giving the world a private, fungible cryptocurrency that can be used by all, and do it all in a manner that is fair, decentralized, and community-driven. Perhaps it’s time to put away the sensationalization and article sharing as a means to shill bags and promote competitors. Perhaps it’s time to tell another story.</p>",
